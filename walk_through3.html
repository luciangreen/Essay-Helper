<html><head><title>Author's Heading</title></head><body><h1>Author's Heading</h1>I will critically analyse Author's Heading.  I will agree with Author's Heading.  Author's Heading is because of a (author 2000, p 2) because of a (author 2000, p 2).  Author's Heading is because of a (author 2000, p 2) because of c (author 2000, p 1).
