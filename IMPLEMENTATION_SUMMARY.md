# Simplified Essay Helper with ChatGPT Integration - Implementation Summary

## Overview

This project successfully implements a simplified version of the Essay Helper in Prolog with ChatGPT integration for finding connections and comments, as requested in the problem statement. The implementation focuses on core functionality while adding AI-powered enhancements.

## What Was Accomplished

### ‚úÖ Core Requirements Met

1. **Simplified Essay Helper in Prolog**: Created a clean, simplified version that removes complex features like KNN algorithms while maintaining core essay generation functionality.

2. **ChatGPT Integration**: Implemented the exact ChatGPT querying pattern specified in the problem statement, including:
   - HTTP JSON library usage
   - Text-to-Breasonings inclusion (stub implementation)
   - API key management
   - Proper curl command construction
   - JSON response parsing
   - Error handling and retry logic

3. **Connection Finding**: Uses ChatGPT to find connections between keywords and essay topics.

4. **Comment Generation**: Uses ChatGPT to generate critical analysis and comments.
