%% Text to Breasonings Module
%% Stub implementation for dependency compatibility

% This is a stub implementation of the Text-to-Breasonings module
% The actual implementation would be included from '../Text-to-Breasonings/text_to_breasonings.pl'

% Placeholder predicates for compatibility
text_to_breasonings(Text, Breasonings) :-
    % Basic implementation that splits text into reasoning units
    split_string(Text, '.', ' ', Sentences),
    findall(Reasoning, (member(Sentence, Sentences), 
                       string_length(Sentence, Len), 
                       Len > 5,
                       format(string(Reasoning), "Reasoning: ~w", [Sentence])), Breasonings).

% Additional helper predicates that might be needed
breasoning_score(_, 1.0). % Default score
validate_breasonings(Breasonings, Breasonings). % Pass-through validation
