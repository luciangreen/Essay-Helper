# Simplified Essay Helper with ChatGPT Integration

This is a simplified version of the Essay Helper implemented in Prolog with ChatGPT integration for finding connections and generating comments.

## Features

- **ChatGPT Integration**: Uses OpenAI's ChatGPT API to generate connections and critical analysis
- **Graceful Fallback**: Works without API key by providing fallback responses
- **Clean Implementation**: Focused on core functionality without complex dependencies

## Files

- `final_simple_essay_helper.pl` - Main simplified essay helper with ChatGPT integration
- `chatgpt_qa_key.pl` - API key management (set your OpenAI API key here)
- `text_to_breasonings.pl` - Stub implementation for compatibility

## Setup

1. **Install SWI-Prolog** (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install swi-prolog
   ```

2. **Set OpenAI API Key** (optional - system works without it):
   - Edit `chatgpt_qa_key.pl`
   - Replace the empty string with your actual API key:
     ```prolog
     chatgpt_key("sk-your-actual-openai-api-key-here").
     ```

### API Integration Details

The ChatGPT integration follows the specification in the problem statement:

- Implements proper JSON parsing
- Includes error handling and fallback behavior
- Cleans input text to prevent API issues
